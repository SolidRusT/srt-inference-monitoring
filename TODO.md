# TODO

## Features to Implement

1. **Enhanced Visualization**:
   - Add more detailed graphs and charts to the dashboard.
   - Allow users to select specific time ranges for metrics.
   - Implement real-time updates for the dashboard.

2. **User Authentication**:
   - Secure the dashboard with user authentication.
   - Implement different user roles (e.g., admin, viewer).

3. **Alerting System**:
   - Set up alerts for specific metrics thresholds (e.g., high CPU usage).
   - Send alerts via email or integration with a messaging service.

4. **Historical Data Storage**:
   - Store historical metrics data for longer-term analysis.
   - Implement features to query and visualize historical data.

5. **Customizable Metrics**:
   - Allow users to define and collect custom metrics.
   - Provide a user interface for managing custom metrics.

6. **Support for Additional Exporters**:
   - Add support for more Prometheus exporters.
   - Ensure the application can handle metrics from a variety of sources.
